# Plain Language Medical Dictionary

The Plain Language Medical Dictionary (PLMD) widget is a project of the University of Michigan Taubman Health Sciences Library as part of the Michigan Health Literacy Awareness project, aimming to help people with a non-medical background better understand the medical terms. 

The initial version was designed in 2011 and published in three versions: website widget, iOS mobile application, and Android mobile application. In 2019, the widget was redesigned to a responsive webpage as one of [the Library Engagement Fellow projects](https://engage.lib.umich.edu/engagement-fellows/).

- Report incorrect definitions & Request more medical terms

To further enrich our repository and keep this product updated, we designed this updating system that allows users to request definitions of terms we do not have and report information they think are incorrect. We will collect these feedback and update the repository sustainably.

## Development

The widget is built with React.js and the development language is English. The algorithm used for term search is based on [levenshtein-distance](https://github.com/trekhleb/javascript-algorithms/tree/master/src/algorithms/string/levenshtein-distance). The thesaurus is stored in the data.json file.
